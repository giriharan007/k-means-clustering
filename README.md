K-means clustering is a popular and widely used method for partitioning a dataset into a set of distinct, non-overlapping subgroups or clusters. Here is a breakdown of how K-means clustering works and some of its key concepts:

centroids randomly. These centroids are the initial points that represent the center of each cluster.

**Assignment Step:**

Assign each data point to the nearest centroid based on a distance metric (typically Euclidean distance). This forms 
K clusters.

**Update Step:**

Calculate the new centroids by taking the mean of all data points assigned to each cluster.

**Repeat:**

Repeat the Assignment and Update steps until the centroids no longer change significantly (i.e., convergence) or for a fixed number of iterations.

**Key Concepts**

**Centroids:** The center of each cluster.

**Distance Metric:** The measure used to determine the nearest centroid. Commonly, Euclidean distance is used.

**Convergence:** The point at which the algorithm stops because the centroids have stabilized and do not change significantly with further iterations.

**Inertia:** A measure of how well the clusters are defined. It is the sum of squared distances from each point to its assigned centroid.
